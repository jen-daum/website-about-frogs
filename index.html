        Frogs are fascinating creatures with a wide variety of species found all
        over the world. They are known for their jumping abilities, croaking
        sounds, bulging eyes, and slimy skin. Frogs play a vital role in the
        ecosystem as both predators and prey, making them important indicators
        of environmental health.
